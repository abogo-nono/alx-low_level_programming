## Introduction

Search algorithms are essential for efficiently finding an element within a data structure. This repository covers a variety of search algorithms, each suited for different types of data and search requirements. Whether you are a student learning about algorithms, a developer looking to implement efficient search strategies, or just a curious programmer, this repository will be a valuable resource.

## Algorithms Included

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Jump Search
- Exponential Search
- Interpolation Search
- Ternary Search
- Fibonacci Search

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/abogo-lincoln/Search-Algorithms.git
    cd Search-Algorithms
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Algorithm**:
    Each algorithm is organized into directories by name.

3. **Compile and Run the Code**:
    Follow the instructions in the specific algorithm directory to compile and run the code. For example, to run the Binary Search implementation:

    ```sh
    cd Binary-Search
    gcc binary_search.c -o binary_search
    ./binary_search
    ```
